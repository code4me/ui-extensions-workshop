# 4me Advanced UI Extensions Workshop

TODO: description

## What you will learn during this workshop

### Conditionals

A common scenario in UI extensions is the need to conditionally hide or show
certain fields and/or values. Depending on the business rules behind the form,
this can become very complex, very quickly.

We will look at a number of techniques to keep this complexity under control and
thus keeping the UI extension maintainable.

### ITRP.record

Detecting full ui / self-service  
ITRP.record.context => 'full_ui' or 'self_service'

More ITRP.record:
- ITRP.record.new
- ITRP.record.initialValues
- ITRP.record.initialValues.custom_data
- ITRP.record.initialValues.get()

Conditional logic on other fields outside of extension like #req_status.

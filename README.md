# 4me Advanced UI Extensions Workshop

![UI extensions](images/ui-extensions.png)

## What you will learn during this workshop

A common scenario in UI extensions is the need to conditionally hide or show
certain fields and/or values. Depending on the business rules behind the form,
this can become very complex, very quickly.

In this workshop we will look at a number of techniques to keep this complexity
under control and thus keeping the UI extension maintainable:

* using CSS instead of JavaScript,
* using configuration objects,
* generating dynamic lists,
* detecting Self Service,
* using the extensions API.

During the exercises and the discussion of the answers we will explain more
about the way the UI extensions work and also show you ways to create more
powerful extensions.

## Prerequisites

We assume that you are familiar with creating a simple UI extension.

During the workshop you will write HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You do not have to
be an expert and should be able to understand the answers when they are
discussed after each exercise.

The complete answers are provided for each exercise. Even if you were not able
to finish the exercise, you can copy/paste the answers and continue with the
next exercise.

Working in pairs is more fun and is encouraged!

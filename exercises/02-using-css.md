## Exercise 2: Using CSS

A new requirement comes in! Employees have been asking for extra customizations,
they want to be able to specify:

* the size of the bike, and
* the type of rear shocks of a mountain bike.

This is a relatively simple requirement, but you can already see having to add
JS code in a couple of different places. It is easy to forget something,
especially when there 10 options instead of 2 in this example.

### Exercise

Implement requirement without increasing the number of lines of JavaScript. You
can use CSS to achieve this.

### Hints

* Add a wrapper element around the fields whose visibility is dependent on the
  selected bicycle type.
* Create CSS classes that specify which fields are for each role.

Good luck!

## Exercise 5: Using dynamic options

It turns out that bicycles come in all kinds of different frame sizes and these
sizes differ for every type of bike.

![Frame sizes for a road bike](../images/04-sizes.png)

You are asked to replace the free text field for 'Size' by a select with the
following options:

* When type 'Road' is selected show sizes 44 to 66.
* When type 'Mountain' is selected show sizes 13 to 22.
* When type 'Recumbent' is selected there are only one size: 42

### Exercise

Implement requirement without specifying the select options in HTML.

You can use the jQuery `$element.html(htmlString)` function to set the HTML
contents of the element referenced by `$element`.

Good luck!
